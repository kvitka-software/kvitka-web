Kvitka is a company founded in October 2019. Its mission is to deliver software with high quality in a world where a lot of "monkeys with typewriters" are producing unreliable, unmaintainable software because they haven't mastered the craftsmanship that is programming.

At Kvitka we take pride in good taste, correctness, readability, maintainability and all the other properties of quality code.

### The Kvitka name

"Kvitka" is a Ukrainian word and means "flower". Why that name, you ask? Who doesn't like a flower? :)

"Kvitka" is also a classic [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8fGSmP3D38) by the popular Ukrainian rock band [Океан Ельзи](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okean_Elzy).
