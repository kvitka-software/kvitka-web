## Personal qualities

Øyvind is easy to get along with. He is self-driven and does not
require a lot of maintenance. He makes no drama, no fuss – respects
decisions that have been made. He's empathetic to managers – their job
isn't easy!

He is happy when he can focus, and doesn't mind diving deeply into
"impenetrable" tasks and do some seriously heavy lifting. He loves to
take on roles where he can increase everyone's productivity by
improving the foundational code base.

Øyvind is comfortable presenting to an audience. He is not an
introvert, but he does have a bit of phone shyness and could never
work as a salesperson or in similar positions where he'd have to make
a lot of cold calls. Excessive task switching is not his greatest
strength.

He has impeccable work ethics and will not be late to appointments or
try to get more than his fair share. He believes strongly in giving
praise to those who deserve it, never engages in fingerpointing when
bad stuff happens, and is comfortable sharing knowledge to the point
that he is fully replaceable.
