[Resume](/static/bakksjo-resume.pdf)

Øyvind is a software developer with a reputation for attention to detail and good taste. He is a Java expert and fluent in languages such as Scala, Go, and Elm. Øyvind's core experience is backend development, but he has also worked on some frontend projects.

## Specialities

- Proper error handling; dealing with *all* code paths, not just the Happy Path
- Concurrency; parallellism without deadlocks or losing insight into what's going on
- Async and reactive processing
- Utilizing the type safety of statically typed languages to eliminate impossible states
- Clean logging - architecting servers that are silent in steady state, but when they *do* log, you get all the information you need to act on it
- Working remotely and managing remote teams
- Speaks and writes fluent conversational Russian, in addition to excellent English

## Personal qualities

Øyvind is easy to get along with. He is self-driven and does not require a lot of maintenance. He's no drama maker, no fuss - respects decisions that have been made. He's empathetic to managers - their job isn't easy!

He is happy when he can focus, and doesn't mind diving deeply into "impenetrable" tasks. Excessive task switching, though, is not his greatest strength.

He has impeccable work ethics and will not be late to appointments or try to get more than his fair share. He believes strongly in giving praise to those who deserve it, and is comfortable sharing knowledge to the point that he is fully replaceable.

Øyvind is not an introvert, but he has a bit of phone shyness and could therefore never work as a salesperson. He is comfortable standing on a stage and presenting to an audience, though.
