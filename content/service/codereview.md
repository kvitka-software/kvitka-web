We measure code quality. Whether you need a full-blown pre-acquisition due diligence process, or just want to improve your product â€“ our services give you full insight into the quality of a codebase and the abilities of a technical team.

Code quality is critical to successful long-term software development. Quality issues in software can manifest themselves as a range of problems, for example:

* Users frequently experience bugs
* Bugs are hard to find and correct
* Fixing a bug introduces new bugs
* Implementing new features, even (seemingly) small features, require a lot of time and resources
* Downtime happens frequently
* The product is slow
* The system requires a lot of resources to run and operate
* Poor insight into what goes on internally
* High churn rate; engineers leave the project

If you have these issues in your project, you might need an unbiased review of the codebase and the team. Or perhaps you are the decision maker in an acquisition process and fear buying "the cat in the sack", but don't have the technical expertise to judge the state of the prospect?

What ever your case is, this is what we do. We have decades of experience with huge, complex software systems from some of the world's largest and most successful technology corporations. We know what good software looks like. We also know what less-than-ideal software looks like...

We will swiftly analyze any codebase or team, small or large, and provide you a detailed report of its quality, value and improvement areas across a number of dimensions such as correctness, performance, maintainability, concurrency, and many more.

Unsure whether you have a case that fits? Give us a call, we don't bite.
